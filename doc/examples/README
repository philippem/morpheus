Sample morpheus scripts.

Philippe McLean
9 January 2001

To run these samples:

1. Add the location of the morpheus executable (on the mayday_dev branch,
tools/morpheus/bin) to your PATH.

2. Choose a network. 

3. Prepare your keys on the machines on that network (use morpheus's
test-ssh option to verify).

4. Create a genesis network config in this directory describing the
network (you may symlink to or copy the current genesis.conf or
genesis-remote.conf).

5. Choose an example. To run it, do

  # ./run-example.pl <example> <network> <network config>


Descriptions of the samples

1

- minimal morpheus example. Executes a module once on each machine on
  a network. Illustrates use of description-file attribute for stages.

2

- example of using different entities. Executes a module on each nym
  server, then another module on each token server, then one module
  exactly once for any aips.

3

- example of running a module once on the master, and sharing data
  between hosts, using the context object. A string is set by the
  master script. A second module executes on each aip and displays the
  string set by the master.

4

- example of sharing data between hosts, using files. The master
  creates a file which is pushed to each slave. Each slave displays
  the pushed file, then creates a file and saves it in the crypt,
  which is pulled back to the master. Finally, the master lists all
  files in the crypt.

5

- example of using the Logger to emit warnings, errors, and fatal
  messages

6

- example of using exclude-entities and defaults in morpheus
  configurations.

7

- example of running non perl code

8 

- example of examining the stage_execution list to recover stage exit codes

Freedom 2.0, on the scarecrow_dev branch, in migration/scarecrow.
